You will have to make a mini Car racing game. The pictures (orthe gifs) which you are going to use for this challenge are sent & they are in
the ‘img’ folder. You will have the starter files, so use those, instead of making new ones.
The game design should be exactly the same as it is shown in the video.On the top of the page, there should be 2 buttons. When you click the first one ‘Race!’ the game starts. When you click the ‘Start over’ button the game resets if it’s finished (meaning: the cars go at the starting positions). The game starts with a countdown, which you will have to create (& is centered relative to the ‘racetrack’). When the countdown reaches 0, it just disappears and the cars start to race. The cars must go to the very end of the ‘racetrack’ and stop there (they should not continue outside of the window). When one of the cars reaches the end, the ‘racetrack’ gets darken and a finish flag appears with an animation on top of the ‘racetrack’. Also, while the race is in progress, the buttons on top should be disabled and you cannot click on any of the buttons until the race finishes. When the race is over, they can be clickable again.
