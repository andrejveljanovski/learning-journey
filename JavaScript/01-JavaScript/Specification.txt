You will solve tasks that are used for developing logic. Solve them in order as the weight of each subsequent task increases.
Tasks can be in one document or 3 different ones.

1. Use conditions to check if a given number is even. If so , print withconsole.log â€œ The Number (TheNumberYouWrote) is even ". If the number is not even, print " The Number (TheNumberYouWrote) is not even".

2. Check which numbers from 10 to 100 are even and divisible by 3. Print with console.log all those that meet these conditions.

3. From the given 3 numbers , find the smallest and largest, and check are they prime.
Example :
Number = 13;
Number2 = 15;
Number3 = 20;
Smallest - 13 , Largest-20
The smallest number 13 is prime , The largest number 20 is not prime.
