# learning-journey

Repository for my front-end journey through mini web apps, starting with HTML/CSS, advancing with media queries, Bootstrap and JavaScript interactivity. Finally, it includes dynamic web apps using React &amp; Next.js. Here you can check out my progress in crafting web applications with a focus on user experiences.

Welcome to my Frontend Development Learning Journey Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my growth and progress as a front-end developer. Here, you will find a collection of projects and exercises that document my journey from the very basics of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to advanced frameworks like React and Next.js.

-Table of Contents

HTML CSS Bootstrap - This folder contains my early work, where I embarked on the exciting journey of front-end development. I explored the fundamentals of HTML, mastered the art of crafting beautiful CSS layouts, and familiarized myself with the power of Bootstrap to create responsive and user-friendly web pages.

JavaScript - As I progressed in my learning, I dedicated considerable time to mastering JavaScript, a language that empowered me to add interactivity and dynamism to my projects. Through hands-on exercises, I gained proficiency in a wide range of concepts. I became adept at manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and handling events, allowing me to create dynamic web pages with interactive elements. I acquired the skills to work effectively with loops and arrays, enabling efficient data handling and manipulation in my projects. Understanding functions and advanced concepts like callback functions became instrumental in writing modular and reusable code. I explored various array methods, providing powerful tools to manage arrays and perform operations with ease. I delved into constructor functions, objects, and classes, allowing me to build organized and scalable applications. Understanding inheritance and scope provided me with the ability to create hierarchies of objects and manage variables effectively. Additionally, I harnessed the power of Date objects to handle time and date-related operations accurately. I also learned about different storage options and the Location API, which facilitated data management and handling URL information in my applications. Overall, my journey in JavaScript has equipped me with a diverse skill set, enabling me to build robust and feature-rich web applications with ease.

React - The React folder marks a turning point in my learning journey. Here, I embraced the component-based architecture and learned how to build modern, scalable, and efficient user interfaces. I explored state management, hooks, and various third-party libraries like Axios for making API requests, date-fns for dates, React Bootstrap and Material UI library, making use of its pre-built components and themes. Furthermore, I gained experience in manipulating the DOM using refs, distinguishing between controlled and uncontrolled components, and effectively using the Reducer pattern for managing state. I also learned about props drilling, lifting state up, and incorporating react-router-dom for handling routing and navigation. Throughout this journey, I discovered the power of Custom Hooks and leveraged the Context API for global state management.

Next.js - Building on my React knowledge, I ventured into the world of server-side rendering and the Next.js framework. This folder showcases my exploration of dynamic web application development, enabling me to create blazing-fast websites with improved SEO and user experience.
