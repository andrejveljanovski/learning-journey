You will have to create an adventure blog application with React. There is data for the places in the db.json file
The page should be responsive for laptop, tablet and mobile devices (you can check the images that are in the screenshots folder).
For all the images use picsum images. The design should be made with components, meaning you need to have 4
components: 
- banner - image with centered content.
- details-block - text on the left, image on the right (you need to make 2 variations from this component with different titles & images)
- places-container - the section that contains all the place components(for all the places info you should use the data that is inside the db.json
file)
- place - individual place component that will be shown in the places-container (image, title, text)
- footer - list at the bottom
